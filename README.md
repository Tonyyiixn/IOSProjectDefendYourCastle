Our code is built using XCode, which can only be ran on macOS devices (Apple laptops).
Make sure you have XCode installed, then start a new project with games selected as category.
Once a new project is created. Click Integrate from the top, white panel.
From the drop down options select Clone and put in the GitHub repository link. Then clone the main branch.
Finally, you can run the code by clicking the play button. A simulator will start shortly after.
If this is the first time launching the iPhone simulator, it may take some time to install.
