Our code is built using XCode, which can only be ran on macOS devices (Apple laptops).
Make sure you have XCode installed, select clone Git Repository and put in the GitHub repository link. Then clone the main branch.
Finally, you can run the code by clicking the play button. A simulator will start shortly after.
If this is the first time launching the iPhone simulator, it may take some time to install.
